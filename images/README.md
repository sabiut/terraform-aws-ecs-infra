# Images Directory

This directory is for storing architecture diagrams and other images used in the documentation.

## Recommended Image Files

Place the following PNG images here:
- `architecture-diagram.png` - Overall AWS ECS three-tier architecture
- `network-diagram.png` - Network topology and VPC design
- `deployment-flow.png` - CI/CD and deployment workflow

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG preferred for diagrams
- **Size**: 1200-1600px width recommended
- **File Size**: Keep under 1MB for faster loading
- **Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `ecs-architecture.png`)

## Creating Diagrams

You can create architecture diagrams using:
- **draw.io** - Free online diagramming tool
- **AWS Architecture Icons** - Official AWS icon set
- **Lucidchart** - Professional diagramming tool
- **PlantUML** - Code-based diagrams

## Note

The README currently uses Mermaid diagrams that render automatically on GitHub. If you prefer PNG images, simply:
1. Add your PNG files to this directory
2. Update the image paths in the main README.md file
